                <p>
                    Hello! My name is Eric Crain. I am a 30 year old Junior Front-End Web Developer. I just attended Vanderbilt University's Full Stack Web Developer Coding Bootcamp.

                <p>
                    I am originally from Memphis, TN, but moved east to go to college at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, where I received a Bachelor of Science degree in 2015. The goal back then was to go to school to become a Physical Therapist. I worked at an orthopedic group, Center for Sports Medicine, here in Chattanooga in the Physical Therapy department as a Technician from 2014 to 2020. After tenaciously applying to Phyiscal Therapy School several times, I came to the conclusion that PT school was just not in the cards for me. I took on a new venture and now am currently the Shipping Manager of a wholesale plant nursery where I facilitate the shipping and receiving of various plants and plant products such as containers, ground cloth, fertilizer, etc. Although my path has lead me in other directions, I have always been interested in web development. In fact, it was one of my three choices when deciding my major in college, and looking back now I know it is what I was meant to choose all along.
